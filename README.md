# mb2g-testing

In this project, I use Maven to add JUnit4, Junit5, TestNG libraries to the project and experiment with pom configurations. For each test I created a branch that you can choose from and look at the commits. 

Modifying the plugin configurations was a big part in this project. I also get to use libraries such as Spock and JaCoCo and combine the testing in the same project as shown in the junit4and5 branch
